# Budget App

This is the boilerplate for the Budget App project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/budget-app

## Solution

This is my solution to free code camp's budget_app for the course, "Scientific computing with Python". I've left the main heading and content the same as free code camp has given it.

## Running

To run my code, clone this repository to your local machine, and open a terminal in that directory. You can then install the dependencies with,

```cmd
pip install pytest
```

You can then run tests with `pytest`.
